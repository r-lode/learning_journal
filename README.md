# My Learning Journal ðŸŒ±âœ¨

Welcome to my personal **learning reference guide**! ðŸŽ“

This repository is my way of:  
âœ… Tracking the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve gained over time  
âœ… Consolidating what Iâ€™ve learned in one neat place  
âœ… Practicing coding, math, and data science fundamentals daily  

ðŸš€ **Please note:**  
I donâ€™t view this as a substitute for real-world experience or rigorous project work. Itâ€™s a personal tool â€” a growing collection of notes, code snippets, and small experiments â€” that helps me **stay consistent** and **see my progress**.  

If you find anything here helpful, feel free to use it or fork it! See the `LICENSE` file for details.

Cheers,  
Ryan
